# Dough-Sandwich-Shop-JS-Project


In this course, we have learned many different JavaScript techniques that built upon my other JavaScript class. We have utilized the APIs of many different websites and AJAX server calls for information from these APIs. In this project along, I also had worked with different libraries like Slick JS for an image gallery and Google Maps API for the map and marker on my web pages. I have also used the ip-api for location with city, state and zip code. In order to see the PHP response in this project, you must use a local web server stack like MAMP or XAMPP. This site is for a fictional website of a sandwich shop known as Dough.
